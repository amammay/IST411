      <h1 class="special">Why I Love India</h1>

      <p> It’s not a secret that I had a hard time in India. However, I truly enjoyed two months. It is a strong love and hate relationship.
       From New Delhi to Kolkata, Shimla to Thar Desert, India offers diverse landscape, climate, and cultures.
       Some sites were the most amazing place I’ve ever seen, while the heat was melting me down. It is not the easiest place to live, but it is truly a place like no other</p>

      <h1>Cost of Living</h1>
      <p> Living cost is really cheap: sometimes a private room only costs<em> 300 Rs (5 USD)</em> , and thali is usually 60 Rs (1 USD) </p>
